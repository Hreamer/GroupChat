# GroupChat
This is a group project for a group messaging application using Java.
This project uses Java swing package and Java net packages for most of its implementation.

This program currently only runs on the local computer network.

# Features 
In the current build you can start direct and group messages, edit messages, create accounts, delete accounts, edit password, and delete conversations. 

# How to use
To use the application clone this repository to the directory of your choice. `javac` ALL the .java files to get the .class files for use. Than using 2 seperate instances of the terminal use the command  
`java Server`  
and  
`java Client`  
If you wish to have multiple instances of the client open to message between them than just open another terminal and run the `java Client` command again.  
  *NOTE*: The Server class must be running before all runs of the `java Client` command.
